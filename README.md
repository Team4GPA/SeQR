# SeQR - A User-Friendly and Flexible events app for Android!

SeQR is designed to allow you to create events--events generate QR codes for easy event sharing with potential guests!

### Getting Started:

Note: please ensure your Android Studio emulator is set up with an API Level of 34, the SDK "UpsideDownCake", and the Google Play dependencies installed to the emulator device.

(We use Google's MLKit, Firebase, and Google Services alongside Picasso and JourneyApps zxing barcode APIs)
